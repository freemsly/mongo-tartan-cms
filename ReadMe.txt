Hello.  How to get me running:

1. Get MongoDB and get it running (http://www.mongodb.org)
2. Get some initial content by using NUnit to execute the test 
	Tartan.Tests.PageControllerTest.SetupData();
3. Open ASP.NET Configuration by selecting Tartan.Web in Solution Explorer then choosing
	Project/ASP.NET Configuration.
	A. Create a new User and put it in a new role called "Editor"
4. Hit F5 with Tartan.Web set as your Startup Project to bring it up in Cassini.
